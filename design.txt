ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION
======================

Taken from http://paleyontology.com/AP_CS/hivolts/

Here are some characteristics of the game board.

*   The game board itself is a 12-by-12 bounded grid
*   There are three object types:
    1.  You (the smiley face)
    2.  Twelve (12) Mhos which are stored as a list
    3.  Electric fences which cover the whole perimeter
    4.  Twenty (20) electric fences on the interior

Everything is randomly placed except for the fences that are on the perimeter.

When it is your turn, you are allowed to move to any adjacent square or you can
jump. Adjacent is defined as one square away, either horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal. There are three possibilities when you move onto an adjacent square:

If you move to an adjacent square, one of three things can happen:

1.  You move onto an electric fence and lose.
2.  You move onto a Mho and lose.
3.  You move onto an empty square.

When you jump, you move to a random square, but you are guaranteed that you will
not land on an electric fence. When you jump, it remains your turn to move. So, 
there are only two possibilities if you jump.

1.  You jump onto a Mho and lose.
2.  You jump onto an empty square.

If you jump and do not lose, it remains your turn. Assuming that you move (not
jump) onto an empty square, then the Mhos move, in the order in which they are
stored in the list, as follows:

1.  If you are directly vertical or hortizontal to a Mho, the Mho MUST move
    directly towards you one square. If this results in the Mho landing on an
    electric fence, the Mho is removed from the board. If it lands on an empty
    square, it remains on the board.
2.  If the Mho is not directly horizontal or vertical from you, then it has
    three squares it can move to, the one that is diagonally towards you, one
    that is horizontal so that it would be closer to you, and one that is
    vertical so that it would be closer to you. The Mho will try to move onto
    an empty square in the following order:
    1.  Diagonally towards you
    2.  If the horizontal distance towards you is greater than or equal to the
        vertical distance, move horizontally towards you;
    3.  If the horizontal distance towards you is less than or equal to the
        vertical distance, move vertically towards you;
    4.  If none of these can result in landing on an empty square, repeat the
        order with the attempt to move onto an electric fence
    5.  If none of these can result in landing on an electric fence, do not
        move (this happens when a Mho can only try to move onto other Mhos)

After each Mho has moved once, it becomes your turn. If there are no Mhos
remaining, you win.

The keys for moving you should be:

Q: up and left
W: up
E: up and right
A: left
S: sit (stay on the same square for one turn)
D: right
Z: down and left
X: down
C: down and right
J: jump

If the user has won or lost, that should be indicated, along with a prompt
asking if they want to play again.

MY NOTES
========

It's BASIC therefore there is a lot of spaghetti but I tried to use subroutines
to make the code more modular wherever I could.
